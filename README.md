## Introduction

My Emergency QR application utilizes cutting-edge technologies, including Next.js, Css, Tailwind, typescript and Clerk, to provide an exceptional user experience. Below, we explain how to get started using it.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:**  A JavaScript library that makes it easy to build interactive user interfaces. It is built on top of React and provides features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
- **Css:** CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language that is used to style web pages. CSS is used to control the appearance of elements on a web page, such as their size, color, and position. 
- **Tailwind:** A CSS framework that provides a set of utility classes that you can use to style your web application. Tailwind CSS is very flexible and allows you to create custom designs without having to write a lot of CSS code.
- **Typescript:** A programming language that builds on JavaScript, adding static typing to the language. Static typing helps to prevent errors and makes your code more reliable.
- **Clerk:** Is a cloud-based authentication platform. Clerk provides a variety of features for authenticating users, such as single sign-on, social login, and passwordless authentication.
